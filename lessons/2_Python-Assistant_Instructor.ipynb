When you start teaching with the D-Lab, you will start as an assistant instructor and then becaome an instructor. We recommend that you focus on teaching one workshop each semester as instructor (and explore many different workshops as an assistant instructor). The next step (before you teach your first workshop) will be to review the Guide to Zoom for D-Labbers document and attend a Mock Teaching Session with another instructor."
