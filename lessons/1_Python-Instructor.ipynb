To that end, we've asked you to prepare a 2-3 segment of a workshop that you might teach, and we will practice with that today. \n"

    "#### 2. Mention the scope of the workshop\n",

    "\n",
    "*Example:* \"The D-Lab motto is IOKN2K!, or It's OK Not To Know- this means that we want you to feel comfortable asking questions or expressing when you don't know something - we are all here to learn together!\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 4. Show D-Lab resources\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* \"I'll share my screen with the D-Lab website. We have a lot of upcoming workshops- for example  We have consulting services, which are a great way to get started with a new project and get 1-on-1 help.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 5. Engage participants: Ask 2-3 questions to get to know your participants more\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* \"Put a 0 in the chat if you have never attended a D-Lab workshop before, and a 1 in the chat if you have\""

    "## Open vs Closed questions\n",
    "\n",
    "One key tip for asking questions in Zoom workshops is to consider open vs closed questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open questions**: Questions that are open-ended e.g. \"What do you notice about this figure?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closed questions**: Questions that have constrained answer space e.g. \"In this figure, is group A or group B higher?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are useful, but open questions require more work from participants to answer, which means that it also takes longer for them to answer. Closed questions may be less deep, but have higher rates of participant engagement. \n",
    "\n",
    "In your teaching, consider the phrasing of your questions carefully- use closed questions more frequently, and open questions sparingly for key concepts."
