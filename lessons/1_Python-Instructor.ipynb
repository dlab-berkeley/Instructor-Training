    "\n",
    "#### 1. Introduce Instructors, Helpers\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* \"Hi I'm Emily and I am a PhD student in Linguistics. I've been teaching with the D-Lab since I started graduate school, and I'm excited to share my experience with you in our Instructor Training. Today I am joined by...\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2. Mention the scope of the workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* \"Today's workshop will focus on practicing our teaching and getting/ giving feedback. We will take a short break halfway through the workshop (around the top of the hour)\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 3. Introduce IOKN2K!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* \"The D-Lab motto is IOKN2K!, or It's OK Not To Know- this means that we want you to feel comfortable asking questions or expressing when you don't know something - we are all here to learn together!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 4. Show D-Lab resources\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* \"I'll share my screen with the D-Lab website. We have a lot of upcoming workshops- for example Python Fundamentals as an overview of how Python works. We also have consulting services, which are a great way to get started with a new project and get 1-on-1 help.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 5. Engage participants: Ask 2-3 questions to get to know your participants more\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* \"Put a 0 in the chat if you have never attended a D-Lab workshop before, and a 1 in the chat if you have\""

    "**Open questions**: Questions that are open-ended e.g. \"What do you notice about this figure?\"\n",
