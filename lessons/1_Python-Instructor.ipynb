    "\n",
    "#### 1. Introduce Instructors, Assistant Instructors, Helpers\n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "#### 2. Mention the scope of the workshop\n",

    "- *Example:* \"Today's workshop will focus on practicing our teaching and getting/ giving feedback. We will take a short break halfway through the workshop (around the top of the hour)\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 3. Introduce IOKN2K! \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Example 1:* \"The D-Lab motto is IOKN2K!, or It's OK Not To Know- this means that we want you to feel comfortable asking questions or expressing when you don't know something - we are all here to learn together!\"\n",
    "- *Example 2:* \"It's easy to forget simple things--for instance, how to run a cell in Python\" (Showing humility in doing \"easy\" activities instead of presenting yourself as an expert, indicating all questions are welcome)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Show D-Lab resources (Only Part 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Example:* \"I'll share my screen with the D-Lab website. We have a lot of upcoming workshops- for example Python Fundamentals as an overview of how Python works. We also have consulting services, which are a great way to get started with a new project and get 1-on-1 help.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 5. Engage participants: Ask 2-3 questions to get to know your participants and get to know their needs\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Example 1:* \"Put a 0 in the chat if you have never attended a D-Lab workshop before, and a 1 in the chat if you have\"\n",
    "- *Example 2:* \"What did you have for breakfast this morning?\"\n",
    "- *Example 3:* \"What's the most boring thing you did last weekend\"\n",
    "- *Example 4:* \"What is one thing you are excited to learn today / what is one thing that confused you in the previous workshop?\""

    "## Open vs Closed questions\n",
    "\n",
    "One key tip for asking questions in Zoom workshops is to consider open vs closed questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open questions**: Questions that are open-ended, e.g. \"What do you notice about this figure?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closed questions**: Questions that have constrained answer space, e.g. \"In this figure, is group A or group B higher?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are useful, but open questions require more work from participants to answer, which means that it also takes longer for them to answer. Closed questions may be less deep, but have higher rates of participant engagement. \n",
    "\n",
    "In your teaching, consider the phrasing of your questions carefully--use closed questions more frequently, and open questions sparingly for key concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's tempting to ask multiple questions at once in the hope that someone will answer one of them, the reality is that people will answer none of them. Make sure to keep your focus on one question at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to do if *you* don't know the answer to a question\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don't panic! It's Okay Not To Know. Nothing bad will happen if you admit to not knowing.\n",
    "2. Ask Assistant Instructors--maybe they will know the answer.\n",
    "3. Do a live Google Search (as long as you are able to recognize the right answer).\n",
    "4. Say you will look up the answer during the break."
