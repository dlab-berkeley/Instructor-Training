    "Last session we talked about why we teach, today we will focus on how we teach. The primary goal of today is to give you a chance to practice in a low-pressure, low-stakes environment. To that end, we've asked you to prepare a 2-3 segment of a workshop that you might teach, and we will practice with that today. \n",

    "- Zoom Helper: confirms logistical details, helps with set-up issues\n",

    "    **Example:** \"Hi I'm Emily and I am a PhD student in Linguistics. I've been teaching with the D-Lab since I started graduate school, and I'm excited to share my experience with you in our Instructor Training.\"\n",

    "2. Mention the scope of the workshop\n",

    "    \n",
    "4. Show D-Lab resources\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:** \"I'll share my screen with the D-Lab website. We have consulting services, which are a great way to get started with a new project and get 1-on-1 help.\"\n",

    "In the Zoom environment it can be especially tricky to keep participats engaged in the workshop, but it's well worth the effort - both instructors and participants report enjoying the workshop more when participants are more engaged. In the D-Lab, we practice the **10-minute rule**: Expectations for participant engagement are set in the first 10 minutes of the workshop. There are two types of expectations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explicit expectations**: Saying things like \"After the challenges I will ask for volunteers to show their work\"\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Asking for participants to put a question in the chat\n",
    "2. Asking for a short answer (e.g. 0-1) in chat\n",

    "4. Using a Zoom poll\n",

    "## Open vs Closed questions\n",
    "\n",
    "One key tip for asking questions in Zoom workshops is to consider open vs closed questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open questions**: Questions that are open-ended e.g. \"What do you notice about this figure?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closed questions**: Questions that have constrained answer space e.g. \"In this figure, is group A or group B higher?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are useful, but open questions require more work from participants to answer, which means that it also takes longer for them to answer. Closed questions may be less deep, but have higher rates of participant engagement. \n",
    "\n",
    "In your teaching, consider the phrasing of your questions carefully- use closed questions more frequently, and open questions sparingly for key concepts."
