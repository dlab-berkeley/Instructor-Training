    "- Managing any Zoom / back-end organization such as breakout rooms, waiting rooms, solving technical problems\n",
    "- Answering questions in the chat\n",
    "- Enhancing instruction by helping fill gaps in instructor knowledge (IOKN2K!), sharing blog posts/links in the chat, or adding in tips/best practice from personal experience.\n",
