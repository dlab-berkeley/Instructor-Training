This repository contains the materials for D-Lab's Instructor Training workshop. 

## Workshop Goals

In this workshop, we provide an overview of D-Lab workshop instruction. In part one, you will reflect on and practice pedagogical approaches to ensure learning goals are communicated and learners are motivated. In part two, you will learn how to introduce, teach and engage participants in D-Lab workshops.


## Learning Objectives

After part one of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Reflect on your past experiences and goals as instructors.
- Practice pedagogical approaches to ensure learning goals are communicated and learners are motivated.
- Receive support about your teaching.
- Help to foster a culture of learning and growth.

After part two of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Introduce D-Lab workshops.
- Distinguish between the different sections used in workshop notebooks.
- Practice teaching and engaging participants.
- Connect principles of teaching to workshop instruction.

## Installation Instructions

Before attending the workshop, you should install Python and Jupyter to your computer. If you need help, please submit a [consulting request](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting/submit-consulting-request) with D-Lab prior to the start of the workshop.

Anaconda is software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks on your computer. Installing Anaconda is the easiest way to make sure you have all the necessary software to run the materials for this workshop. Complete the following steps:

1. [Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.9 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

2. Download the materials in this repository:

* Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
* Click "Download Zip".
* Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `git clone git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/Instructor-Training.git`.

## Run the code

Now that you have all the required software and materials, you need to run the code:

1. Open the Anaconda Navigator application. You should see the green snake logo appear on your screen. Note that this can take a few minutes to load up the first time.

2. Click the "Launch" button under "Jupyter Lab" and navigate through your file system to the `Python-Fundamentals` folder you downloaded above.

3. Navigate to lessons

4. Open the `Python-Instructor.ipynb` notebook to begin.

5. Press Shift + Enter (or Ctrl + Enter) to run a cell.

## Is Python not working on your laptop?

If you do not have Anaconda installed and the materials loaded on your workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking this button:

[![Datahub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](http://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FInstructor-Training&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2FInstructor-Training%2F)

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and allows you to run the materials in a Jupyter notebook that is stored on UC Berkeley's servers. No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the `Python-Fundamentals` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you cannot run these materials.
